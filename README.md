# VSU-CTF-Toolkit

Github repo containing installations for tools needed for CTF stuff
Sorted by OS, Then the specific Category that it deals with

If the tool is a link, please post below under the Category it deals with and a short description of what it does

Notes: 
1. The Tool tcpdump exists natively in Linux, but exists in Windows as Windump, They're interchangable. Install Npcap first then Windump
2. Burp Community Edition exists as both a Network Analysis and Web Exploit Tool, but it's in the Network Analysis folder because why not
3. Same case with Nmap, Nmap in windows can be used the same way as nc or ncat in linux
4. The Linux folder contains scripts to install packages, please look up how to run shell scripts and feel free to read through them, they might contain a virus idk.
5. The shell scripts are working under the assumption that you're using Ubuntu or a similar distro, if not then check the script for the packages and install them accordingly
